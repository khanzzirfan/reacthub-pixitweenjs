## Description

PixiTweenJs is designed to help you build animated time-controlled canvas elements on web apps using extensible Pixijs Components underneath. The package composes the reacthub/pixitweenjs Web Component package. You can use these Web Components flexibly, either from npm packages, from the CDN, or you can bring it into your project to customize and extend it.
