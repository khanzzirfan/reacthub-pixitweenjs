# Setting up a timeline using PixiJS Sprites and Sequences

A common way is to setup each PixiJs sprites as child component of a `PixiSequence` component. This way PixiSequence can take care of mounting and unmouting component at a given start and end times.

<br />

## Example

```
export const Timeline = (props: TimelineProps) => {
    // ... state/effects/refs/ etc
    const { sequences } = props;
    return (
        <GsapPixieContextProvider>
            <ChakraProvider>
                <Flex flexDir={"column"}>
                    {/* PixiJS Stage */}
                    <PixiStage
                        width={width}
                        height={height}
                        options={{ backgroundColor: backgroundColorx, resolution: 2 }}
                    >
                        {/* PixiJS Sequence Wrapper for total duration of timeline in seconds */}
                        <PixiSequenceWrapper startAt={0} endAt={25}>
                            {/* PixiJS Sequence 1 */}
                            <PixiSequence startAt={sequences[0].startAt} endAt={sequences[0].endAt}>
                            {/* PixiJS Image Sprite 1 */}
                            <PixiImageSprite
                                // ...props
                            />
                            </PixiSequence>
                            {/* Other PixiJS Sequences and Sprites */}
                        </PixiSequenceWrapper>
                    </PixiStage>

                    {/* Video Seek Bar Component */}
                    <Box mt={5} w={700}>
                    <VideoSeekBar />
                    </Box>
                </Flex>
            </ChakraProvider>
        </GsapPixieContextProvider>
    );
};

```

## The Fundamentals

### GsapPixieContextProvider

The `<GsapPixieContextProvider />` component serves as a context provider for integrating the GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) library with PixiJS within a React application. By wrapping components in this context provider, it establishes a shared context for animation control, enabling seamless coordination between GSAP and PixiJS functionalities. This integration is essential for managing and synchronizing complex animations, timelines, and sequences involving PixiJS elements, providing a unified and efficient solution for animation development in a React environment.

### PixiStage

The PixiStage component is a key element in PixiJS, a powerful 2D rendering library for the web. The Stage should be defined at the root leven of the canvas component to render all the pixijs sprites.

### PixiSequenceWrapper

The PixiSequenceWrapper component is a custom wrapper designed to facilitate the organization and management of sequences of PixiJS elements

- Sequence Organization:
  The primary purpose of PixiSequenceWrapper is to organize and group PixiJS elements into sequences, allowing for a structured representation of animations over time.
- Timeline Control:
  It serves as a container for sequences, defining a specific duration or timeframe during which the encapsulated PixiJS elements will be animated. The startAt and endAt props determine the timeline range for the sequences within the wrapper.

### PixiSequence

The PixiSequence component plays a crucial role in orchestrating and defining individual sequences of PixiJS elements within the context of a timeline. Here are key points summarizing its usage:

- Temporal Definition:

PixiSequence delineates a specific sequence of PixiJS elements, specifying the time range during which these elements will be animated. The startAt and endAt props set the temporal boundaries for the sequence.

- Integration with PixiSequenceWrapper:

Typically nested within a PixiSequenceWrapper, the PixiSequence component benefits from the wrapper's temporal context and organizational structure. It operates within the timeline defined by its parent wrapper.

- Child of PixiStage:

In the provided code, PixiSequence is a child of the PixiSequenceWrapper, which, in turn, is nested within the PixiStage. This hierarchy ensures proper coordination within the PixiJS rendering environment.

- Container for PixiJS Elements:

The PixiSequence encapsulates PixiJS sprites (e.g., PixiImageSprite, PixiVideoSprite, PixiAudioSprite) or other display objects. These elements are then animated within the specified temporal range.

- Modular Animation Workflow:

By encapsulating individual sequences, the component supports a modular and organized animation workflow. Developers can structure animations into distinct sequences, promoting clarity and maintainability.

- Event Handling:

The component allows for the definition of event handlers, such as pointerdown in the provided code. This enables interactive behavior, triggering actions when a user interacts with the PixiJS elements within the sequence.
